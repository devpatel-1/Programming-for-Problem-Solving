// Concept Focus: register storage class

// ðŸ”¹ register int weight;
// 	â€¢	The register keyword requests the compiler to store the variable in a CPU register (instead of RAM) for faster access.
// 	â€¢	Itâ€™s a hint â€” not a command â€” the compiler may ignore it.

// ðŸ”¥ Important Rule:

// You cannot get the address of a variable declared with register using the & (address-of) operator.

// Because:
// 	â€¢	Register variables may be stored in CPU registers, not in regular memory.
// 	â€¢	Hence, no memory address is guaranteed for them.


// int *ptr = &weight;

// â€¢	This line will cause a compile-time error because youâ€™re trying to get the address of a register variable


// Output:
// error: address of register variable â€˜weightâ€™ requested
